SONG LINEUP FOR LITURGY
==================================
The code is in production at multiple parishes.

One of those is at: http://flock.bluepego.com

Laravel and MySQL provide the backend services.

While front-end uses Backbone, it utilizes Marionette to simplify and to reduce boilerplate code inherent in Backbone. Bootstrap and jQuery provide CSS styling for responsive layout, for both desktop and mobile clients.

It also uses standard tools such as Require, Uglify ...etc. to package and compact the frontend network load.
